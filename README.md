## Christoffel App

### Project Overview
The Christoffel App is a mobile application designed for Chef Christoffel, a private chef who specializes in offering personalized culinary experiences. The app allows Chef Christoffel to easily manage and update his menu offerings and provides clients with the ability to view, filter, and interact with the menu through a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Menu Display**: Clients can browse the current menu offerings categorized by starters, mains, and desserts.
- **Menu Management**: Chef Christoffel can add new dishes or remove existing ones from the menu directly through the app.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Users can filter the menu to find dishes that meet their dietary preferences or dish type.
- **Booking Integration**: Allows clients to book culinary experiences based on available dates directly through the app.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native, providing a native app experience on both iOS and Android platforms.
- **Backend**: Node.js for handling business logic; MongoDB for data storage.
